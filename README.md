## Getting Started
First, change the directory to server and client with 2 separate terminals:

```bash
cd client
cd server

```
Second, Install node_modules for client(frontend) and server(backend):

```bash
npm install

```
Third, run the development server for the client and server:

```bash
npm run dev

```
P/s: You can run the server(backend) with some other code too:
```bash
node index.js
nodemon index.js

```
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.
The server will run on [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
You can start editing the page by modifying `client/app/page.tsx` `client/app/[folder]/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
